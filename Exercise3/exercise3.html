        <p> Hello, my name is Jayhawk. I was born in 1946. Many thought 
        my predecessor was too angry, so they made me happy! I've been through
        a lot of history, including 4 NCAA Tournament National Championships. 
	Now the football team is doing good again too! We started the year 5-0!
	Academia is doing better than ever as well, as we are till considered a
	Tier 1 Institution. </p>
